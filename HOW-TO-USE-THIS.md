# How to Use This Template Repository

This is a template for starting new bioinformatics projects with reproducible, self-contained software environments.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone this template

```bash
cd /projects/standard/GROUP/shared/ris/USER
git clone "git@github.umn.edu:lmnp/newproject.git" my_project_name
cd my_project_name
```

### 2. Make it your own

```bash
# Remove template git history
rm -rf .git

# Initialize as new repo
git init

# Update readme.md with your project information
# Update changelog.md with your project start date
```

### 3. Build software environments

```bash
cd software
sbatch 010_minforge.slurm  # Build miniforge (required for conda)
sbatch 011_conda1.slurm    # Build main conda (R & python) environment
sbatch 012_conda2.slurm    # Build tricky environment
```

Each script can also be run as a shell script: `bash 010_minforge.slurm`

### Output Directory Structure

**Key Concept:** Each build script creates a numbered output directory that matches the script name:
- `software/010_minforge.slurm` → `software_out/010_miniforge/`
- `software/011_conda1.slurm` → `software_out/011_conda1/`
- `software/021_apptainer1.slurm` → `software_out/021_apptainer1/`

This makes it crystal clear which script built what output. You can delete the entire `software_out/` directory and rebuild everything from scratch using the scripts in `software/`.

## Three Methods for Installing Software

This template demonstrates three methods for managing software dependencies:

### Method 1: Conda Environments (01x series)

Build custom conda environments from YAML specifications.

```bash
sbatch 010_minforge.slurm  # Build miniforge (local conda installer)
sbatch 011_conda1.slurm    # Build main (R & python) environment (tidyverse, ggplot2, etc.)
sbatch 012_conda2.slurm    # Build tricky environment (old version of tools or conflicts with conda1, etc.)
```

**When to use:**
- You need R or Python packages
- You want full control over package versions
- You need a mix of conda and pip packages

**Configuration files:**
- `software/conda1.yml` - Main environment (R & python) specification
- `software/conda2.yml` - Tricky environment specification
- `software_out/011_conda1/use_conda1.sh` - Auto-generated activation script (created by 011_conda1.slurm)
- `software_out/012_conda2/use_conda2.sh` - Auto-generated activation script (created by 012_conda2.slurm)

### Method 2: Build Custom Apptainer Containers (02x series)

Build containers from definition files for maximum reproducibility.

```bash
sbatch 021_apptainer1.slurm  # Build Picard container from apptainer1.def
```

**When to use:**
- You need tools not available in conda
- You want maximum reproducibility
- You need to share exact environments with collaborators

**Configuration files:**
- `software/apptainer1.def` - Picard container definition
- `software_out/021_apptainer1/apptainer1.sif` - Built container (created by 021_apptainer1.slurm)

### Method 3: Download Prebuilt Containers (03x series)

Download existing containers from Docker Hub or other registries.

```bash
sbatch 031_deepvariant.slurm  # Download DeepVariant from Docker Hub
```

**When to use:**
- Standard tools with official Docker images exist
- You want to use the "official" version of a tool
- You need to quickly get started without building

## Using the Environments

### Important: Activation Scripts are Auto-Generated

The activation scripts are **automatically generated** when you build each conda environment and stored in numbered output directories:
- `software_out/011_conda1/use_conda1.sh` (generated by `011_conda1.slurm`)
- `software_out/012_conda2/use_conda2.sh` (generated by `012_conda2.slurm`)

These scripts:
- **NOT tracked in git** (in `.gitignore`), but are defined by the git tracked software/01x_* scripts
- **Regenerated every time you rebuild an environment**
- **Use standard `conda activate`**: Works in all contexts including SLURM, terminals, and Open OnDemand RStudio
- **Contain absolute paths**: No confusion about which miniforge/environment to use

When you build an environment, two sets of scripts are created:
1. **Activation helper** (in `software_out/0XX_*/`): Simplified sourcing of conda environment
2. **Conda hooks** (in `${CONDA_PREFIX}/etc/conda/activate.d/` and `deactivate.d/`): Automatically manage `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

### In SLURM Scripts

Activate conda environments by sourcing the auto-generated scripts:

**For R (conda1):**
```bash
PROJECT_ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/.." && pwd)"
source "${PROJECT_ROOT}/software_out/011_conda1/use_conda1.sh"
```

**For Python (conda2):**
```bash
PROJECT_ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/.." && pwd)"
source "${PROJECT_ROOT}/software_out/012_conda2/use_conda2.sh"
```

**For Apptainer containers:**
```bash
PROJECT_ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/.." && pwd)"
CONTAINER_SIF="${PROJECT_ROOT}/software_out/021_apptainer1/apptainer1.sif"
PROJECT_REAL_PATH="$(realpath "${PROJECT_ROOT}")"
apptainer exec --bind "${PROJECT_REAL_PATH}:${PROJECT_REAL_PATH}" "${CONTAINER_SIF}" picard <command>
```

**Switching between conda environments:**

The `use_conda*.sh` scripts can be sourced multiple times in the same session:

```bash
source software_out/011_conda1/use_conda1.sh  # Activate conda1
# ... do R work ...

source software_out/012_conda2/use_conda2.sh  # Switch to conda2
# ... do Python work ...
```

### In RStudio Server (Open OnDemand)

The auto-generated activation scripts work seamlessly with Open OnDemand using the standard `conda activate` method.

**Using the Custom Environment box**

When launching RStudio via Open OnDemand, put this in the "Custom Environment" box (DO NOT select a MSI module R version from the dropdown):

```bash
source /projects/standard/lmnp/knut0297/lmnp_org/newproject/software_out/011_conda1/use_conda1.sh
```

**Replace the path with your actual project path!**

**To verify in RStudio:**
```r
.libPaths()                    # Should show conda1 path first
library(tidyverse)             # Should load successfully
Sys.getenv("CONDA_PREFIX")     # Should show conda1 environment path
Sys.getenv("LD_LIBRARY_PATH")  # Should show conda1 library paths first
```

**Troubleshooting OOD RStudio:**
- Make sure you've built the conda1 environment first: `sbatch software/011_conda1.slurm`
- The activation script must exist: `software_out/011_conda1/use_conda1.sh`
- Use the **absolute path** in the Custom Environment box
- If RStudio fails to start, check the job output logs for error messages
- If packages fail to load, check that `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is set correctly (see verification above)

## Demo Scripts

Three example scripts demonstrate each software method:

```bash
cd code
sbatch demo_r_analysis.slurm        # Uses conda1 (R & python environment)
sbatch demo_python_analysis.slurm  # Uses conda2 (tricky environment)
sbatch demo_apptainer1.slurm       # Uses apptainer1.sif (Picard container)
```

## Library Path Management (LD_LIBRARY_PATH)

Each conda environment automatically manages `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to ensure proper library loading:

### How It Works

When you activate a conda environment (e.g., `conda activate conda1`), conda automatically runs activation scripts that:
1. Save your current `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
2. Prepend conda environment library paths:
   - **R libraries**: `${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib/R/lib` (for R packages with compiled code)
   - **General libraries**: `${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib` (for most conda packages)
   - **GCC runtime libraries**: `${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib/gcc/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu/VERSION` (if gcc is installed)
3. Keep system paths at the end for fallback

When you deactivate or switch environments, your original `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is automatically restored.

### Why This Matters

- **Reproducibility**: Ensures conda's libraries are used, not system libraries
- **Prevents conflicts**: Avoids mixing conda libraries with system libraries
- **R package compatibility**: R packages with compiled code (`.so` files) find the correct libraries
- **CLIA compliance**: Precise control over library versions for validated environments

### Customizing Library Paths

The library path configuration is in:
```
software_out/010_miniforge/miniforge/envs/conda1/etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh
software_out/010_miniforge/miniforge/envs/conda1/etc/conda/deactivate.d/env_vars.sh
```

These are regenerated each time you rebuild the environment via `sbatch software/011_conda1.slurm`.

## Self-Contained Environments

All software is installed within this project directory. **Nothing goes to your home directory.**

### Software Locations

**R packages** (from conda1):
```
software_out/010_miniforge/miniforge/envs/conda1/lib/R/library/
```

**Python packages** (from conda2):
```
software_out/010_miniforge/miniforge/envs/conda2/lib/python3.X/site-packages/
```

**Apptainer containers:**
```
software_out/021_apptainer1/apptainer1.sif
software_out/031_deepvariant/deepvariant.sif
```

**Apptainer cache:**
```
.apptainer/cache/
```

### Benefits

- **Portable**: Clone anywhere and rebuild identical environments
- **Reproducible**: Specific package versions in YAML/definition files
- **Self-contained**: All software in project directory, not $HOME
- **No conflicts**: Independent of system-wide installations
- **Deletable**: Can delete `software_out/` and rebuild from scratch

### System Dependencies

Only one system-level dependency required:
- **Apptainer** (for building and running containers)

Everything else (conda, mamba, R, Python, all packages) is installed locally.

## Modifying Environments

### Adding R Packages to conda1

1. Edit `software/conda1.yml`
2. Add packages under `dependencies:`
3. Rebuild: `sbatch software/011_conda1.slurm`

### Adding Python Packages to conda2

1. Edit `software/conda2.yml`
2. Add packages under `dependencies:`
3. Rebuild: `sbatch software/012_conda2.slurm`

### Adding pip Packages to conda1 (R environment)

conda1 includes Python for R packages that need it (e.g., `r-leiden` needs `leidenalg`).

1. Edit `software/conda1.yml`
2. Add to the `pip:` section:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     - r-leiden
     - python>=3.9
     - pip
     - pip:
         - leidenalg
         - another-package
   ```
3. Rebuild: `sbatch software/011_conda1.slurm`

**Why this works:**
- Conda environments ARE virtual environments
- No separate venv needed
- pip installs to conda1's isolated site-packages
- Everything stays within the project
- Fully reproducible from conda1.yml

### Modifying Containers

**For custom-built containers:**
1. Edit `software/apptainer1.def`
2. Rebuild: `sbatch software/021_apptainer1.slurm`

**For downloaded containers:**
1. Edit `software/031_deepvariant.slurm` to change version
2. Re-download: `sbatch software/031_deepvariant.slurm`

## Environment Exports (Record Keeping)

After building each conda environment, two export files are automatically created in the corresponding output directory:
- `software_out/011_conda1/env_export.yml` and `env_export_from_history.yml`
- `software_out/012_conda2/env_export.yml` and `env_export_from_history.yml`

1. **Full export** (`env_export.yml`): 
   - Complete snapshot of ALL installed packages
   - Exact versions and build strings
   - Platform-specific
   - Use to recreate exact environment

2. **History export** (`env_export_from_history.yml`):
   - Only explicitly requested packages
   - Matches your conda1.yml or conda2.yml
   - Cross-platform
   - Use to understand intent

These are not tracked in git but are useful for:
- Debugging environment issues
- Reproducing exact environments
- Comparing environments over time
- Documentation

## How Activation Scripts Work (Technical Details)

The auto-generated `software_out/use_conda*.sh` scripts use the standard `conda activate` method, which works in all contexts including:
- SLURM jobs
- Interactive terminal sessions
- Open OnDemand RStudio
- Jupyter notebooks

### What Happens When You Source the Script

1. **Conda initialization**: If conda isn't already available, the script sources the miniforge activation script
2. **Environment activation**: Runs `conda activate conda1` (or `conda2`)
3. **Automatic environment setup**: Conda automatically runs scripts in `${CONDA_PREFIX}/etc/conda/activate.d/`, which:
   - Backs up your current `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
   - Sets `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to prioritize conda environment libraries:
     - R libraries: `${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib/R/lib`
     - General libraries: `${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib`
     - GCC libraries: `${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib/gcc/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu/VERSION`
   - Preserves system library paths at the end

### Why LD_LIBRARY_PATH Matters

Setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` ensures that:
- R and other tools find the correct shared libraries (.so files)
- Conda's version of libraries are used instead of system versions
- Prevents conflicts with system-installed libraries
- Provides reproducible library loading order

### Deactivation

When you run `conda deactivate` or switch to another environment:
- The deactivation script in `${CONDA_PREFIX}/etc/conda/deactivate.d/` runs automatically
- Your original `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is restored
- No leftover environment modifications

## Key Features

- **Portable**: Uses absolute paths in generated scripts. Clone anywhere and rebuild.
- **Reproducible**: Specific package versions in configuration files.
- **No modules needed**: Self-contained conda environments.
- **Easy to use**: Single-line activation in scripts.
- **Self-contained**: All software stays in project directory, not $HOME.
- **Automatic library management**: `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is set/restored automatically on activate/deactivate.
- **OOD-compatible**: Works seamlessly with Open OnDemand RStudio.
- **Three methods**: Conda, custom containers, or downloaded containers.

## Naming Conventions

### Software Build Scripts (software/ directory)

- **01x**: Conda environments
  - `010_minforge.slurm` - Build miniforge
  - `011_conda1.slurm` - Build conda environment 1
  - `012_conda2.slurm` - Build conda environment 2

- **02x**: Custom Apptainer containers (built from .def files)
  - `021_apptainer1.slurm` - Build custom container 1
  - `022_apptainer2.slurm` - Build custom container 2

- **03x**: Downloaded containers (from registries)
  - `031_deepvariant.slurm` - Download container 1
  - `032_another.slurm` - Download container 2

### Demo Scripts (code/ directory)

Demo scripts match their corresponding software:
- `demo_r_analysis.slurm` - Demonstrates conda1 (R)
- `demo_python_analysis.slurm` - Demonstrates conda2 (Python)
- `demo_apptainer1.slurm` - Demonstrates apptainer1.sif

### Output Directories

Output directory names match their script names:
- `code/demo_r_analysis.slurm` → `code_out/demo_r_analysis/`
- `code/my_analysis.slurm` → `code_out/my_analysis/`

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Conda activation fails**
A: Make sure you built miniforge first: `sbatch software/010_minforge.slurm`

**Q: R can't find packages**
A: Check `.libPaths()` in R. The conda1 path should be first.

**Q: Apptainer can't access files**
A: Use `--bind` to mount directories. See `code/demo_apptainer1.slurm` for examples.

**Q: Want to delete and rebuild everything?**
A: `rm -rf software_out/ .apptainer/` then rebuild from `software/` scripts.
