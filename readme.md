## Quick Start - Getting Up and Running

### 1. Build Software Environments

```bash
# Build miniforge (required - provides conda)
cd software
sbatch 010_minforge.slurm

# Wait for miniforge to complete, then build conda environments
sbatch 011_conda1.slurm    # Main R & Python environment
sbatch 012_conda2.slurm    # Additional environment (if needed)

# Build/download containers
sbatch 021_apptainer1.slurm  # Custom container (if needed)
sbatch 031_deepvariant.slurm # Downloaded container (if needed)
```

**Alternative:** Run as bash scripts instead of submitting to SLURM:
```bash
cd software
bash 010_minforge.slurm
bash 011_conda1.slurm
```

### 2. Work on an analysis interactively via the command line

```bash
# Navigate to your project's code dir
cd code
source ../software_out/010_miniforge/use_miniforge.sh
conda activate conda1

# Start your analysis (e.g. via R, or python)
R
python
```

### 3. Launch analysis scripts using slurm

```bash
cd code
sbatch demo_analysis.slurm
```
### 4. Start an Open OnDemand RStudio session:

- Visit [https://ondemand.msi.umn.edu](https://ondemand.msi.umn.edu)
- Start an RStudio Server Interactive session
    - Choose MSI account
    - Choose resources
    - Choose R version: None (Custom Environment Provided)
    - Check the Customize Environment box
    - Enter the following into the Custom Environment text box, and then click Launch.

```bash
source /PATH/TO/YOUR/PROJECT/software_out/010_miniforge/use_miniforge.sh
conda activate conda1 # (or whatever conda env name has your R software)
```



## Software Environments

This project uses self-contained, reproducible software environments built from scripts in `software/`:

- **Conda environments** (`01x` series): R, Python, and bioinformatics packages
- **Custom containers** (`02x` series): Built from definition files
- **Downloaded containers** (`03x` series): Pre-built from registries

**Key Features:**
- ✓ Complete isolation from home directory packages
- ✓ Per-environment R configuration (no `~/R/` or `~/.Renviron` interference)
- ✓ Reproducible from version-controlled build scripts
- ✓ Can delete `software_out/` and rebuild from scratch

**Built outputs go to:** `software_out/` (not in git, regenerated from `software/` scripts)



## Results

> Briefly describe the analyses performed in this project. Link to specific scripts or outputs. Alternatively, link to a Google Doc or other files used to track progress. Describe where results/reports can be found (Google Docs, output directories, generated HTML reports, etc.)
