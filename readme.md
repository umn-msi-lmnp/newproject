## Data Locations

### Raw Data

> Document where raw data are stored. These are generally FASTQ files. Include the original UMGC data_delivery path, a Tier 2 backup path (if available), or disaster_recovery path (if available).
```
/projects/standard/GROUP/data_delivery/umgc/YYYY-q1
```
### Analyzed Data

> Document where the analyzed data are stored. This is generally within the GROUP Tier 1 allocated space. 

Project directory on MSI Tier 1:
```
/projects/standard/GROUP/shared/ris/USER/your_project_name_YYYYMMDD

> If the results were backed up to Tier 2, document the bucket and path. Make sure the bucket is owned by the PI, and readable by group members. 

Project backup/archive on MSI Tier 2:
```
s3cmd ls s3://BUCKET/projects/standard/GROUP/shared/ris/USER/your_project_name_YYYYMMDD
```

## Quick Start - Getting Up and Running

> **Note:** Software environments must be built before running analyses. See `GETTING_STARTED.md` for detailed setup instructions.

### 1. Build Software Environments

```bash
# Build miniforge (required - provides conda)
cd software
sbatch 010_minforge.slurm

# Wait for miniforge to complete, then build conda environments
sbatch 011_conda1.slurm    # Main R & Python environment

# Build/download containers (optional)
sbatch 021_apptainer1.slurm  # Custom container
sbatch 031_deepvariant.slurm # Downloaded container
```

**Alternative:** Run as bash scripts instead of submitting to SLURM:
```bash
cd software
bash 010_minforge.slurm
bash 011_conda1.slurm
```

### 2. Work on an analysis interactively via the command line

```bash
# Navigate to your project's code dir
cd code

# You must source this script to activate the conda/miniforge installation
source ../software_out/010_miniforge/use_miniforge.sh
conda activate conda1

# Start your analysis (e.g. via R, or python)
R
python
```

### 3. Launch analysis scripts using slurm

```bash
cd code
sbatch demo_analysis.slurm
```
### 4. Start an Open OnDemand RStudio session

- Visit [https://ondemand.msi.umn.edu](https://ondemand.msi.umn.edu)
- Start an RStudio Server Interactive session
    - Choose MSI account
    - Choose resources
    - Choose R version: None (Custom Environment Provided)
    - Check the Customize Environment box
    - Enter the following into the Custom Environment text box (replace with your actual project path), and then click Launch.

```bash
source /projects/standard/GROUP/shared/ris/USER/PROJECT_NAME/software_out/010_miniforge/use_miniforge.sh
conda activate conda1
```



## Software Environments

This project uses self-contained, reproducible software environments built from scripts in `software/`:

- **Conda environments** (`01x` series): R, Python, and bioinformatics packages
- **Custom containers** (`02x` series): Built from definition files
- **Downloaded containers** (`03x` series): Pre-built from registries

**Key Features:**
- Complete isolation from home directory packages
- Per-environment R configuration (no `~/R/` or `~/.Renviron` interference)
- Reproducible from version-controlled build scripts
- Can delete `software_out/` and rebuild from scratch
- Auto-detecting PROJECT_ROOT paths (manual override available if needed)

**Built outputs:** `software_out/` (not in git, regenerated from `software/` scripts)

See `GETTING_STARTED.md` for detailed documentation.



## Results

> Briefly describe the analyses performed in this project. Link to specific scripts or outputs. Alternatively, link to a Google Doc or other files used to track progress. Describe where results/reports can be found (Google Docs, output directories, generated HTML reports, etc.)

## Changelog

See `changelog.md` for a detailed chronological log of project activities and changes.
